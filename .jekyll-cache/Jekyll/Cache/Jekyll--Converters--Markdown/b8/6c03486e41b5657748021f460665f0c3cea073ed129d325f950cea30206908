<p>Donâ€™t get me wrong, ADFS is great. But it is also a technology with a long history and can (in some cases) be replaced by a better and easier technology in our modern Azure AD World.</p>

<p>But where to start when you have a bunch of applications relying in ADFS?</p>

<p>Or when you might have a relying party to M365 with your federated Azure AD Domain?</p>

<p>Then there are a couple of activities waiting for you â€¦</p>

<p>I attended some sessions last year on shutting down ADFS, and in migrating Relying Party Trusts from ADFS to Azure AD Enterprise Applications, for enduser SSO experiences. From those events and talks I got my own short archive with a list of articles and videos from Microsoft which covers related topics.</p>

<p>In some cases it can make sense to get rid of the ADFS deployment and use PTA or PHS instead and also to move your relying party trusts to Azure AD Enterprise Applications. With this approach you can use the entire stack of Zero Trust features whilst accessing your applications. Conditional access e.g.</p>

<p>Therefore it is a good time to start with migration considerations â€¦ if not done already</p>
